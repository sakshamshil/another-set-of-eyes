# Test File Push

This document was written as a **file first**, then pushed to Another Set of Eyes.

## How It Works

1. Claude writes this file using the `Write` tool
2. Claude reads the file and pushes it via API
3. You see it on your iPad

## Benefits

- No duplicate work
- File exists locally for git
- Also viewable on iPad
- Can be committed to GitHub docs repo

## Code Example

```python
def hello():
    print("This came from a file!")
```
