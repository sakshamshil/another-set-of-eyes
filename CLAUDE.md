# Claude Code Rules

## Git Commits

- Simple commits only
- Simple commit messages only
- NO attribution lines (no "Generated with Claude Code")
- NO Co-Authored-By headers
- NO emojis in commit messages

## Files to NEVER Commit (keep unstaged)

- CLAUDE.md - this file
- plans/ folder - all documentation, plans, tests go here

Do NOT add these to .gitignore. Just never stage them.
